Fantasy Football League aid

This project allows users to enter details of forthcoming Premier League football matches and results for matches that have been played. The data entered will be stored in two files, 'Fixtures.csv' and 'Results.csv'. Once data has been entered, a couple of summary tabs will show a number of stats for each Premier League team, allowing users to easily see each team's recent form and the form of their upcoming opponents. This helps managers of fantasy football teams have an idea of which teams are likely to score goals or not concede goals over the next few weeks.
